##bibliographic database

records are peer-reviewed publications about animal consciousness

make these searchable by

 * taxa referred to (i.e. what claims the authors make about the phylogenetic distribution of consciousness)
 *author
 *abstract
 *topic tags

relate these to a phylogenetic tree for visualization/navigation

# topics
 will have their own little modules, preferably with text articles attached, either externally linked or orig content.


## the core visualization engine

the basic premise of the data visualization project is to display claims made about animal taxanomic groups on a phylogenetic tree, thereby conveying the controversy, debate and uncertainty surrounding the issue, as well as to make the scientific literature accessible by organizing it for exploration in a graphically intuitive way.

# other types of visualization

include concept-relation maps and ciation-network maps
