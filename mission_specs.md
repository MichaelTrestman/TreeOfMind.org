# intro

the evolutionary tree of mind project is an open-source meta-research platform on the evolution of consciousness, cogntion and the emotions in animals. It's aim is to make the entire scientific and philosophical literature on this topic-cluster accessible to everyone in a way that facilitates understanding the fascinating and complex subject. There are a variety of ways to access information, and/or to contribute to the project, depending on whether you are a researcher, a student, or anyone in the world with the access to the web.

the evolutionary tree of mind is was built under NSF Grant blah blah blah

##overall


this project is an attempt to solve a problem of knowledge-agglomeration in a domain of science characterized by controversy and interdisciplinarity, specifically the evolutionary problem of consciousness: which animals are conscious, and in what ancestral animal group(s) did consciousness originat? There is a small (on the scale of contemporary biology) but expanding and literature of peer-reviewed science and philosophy publications, but it is rife with disagreement about terminology and methods. How can the state of such a body of research best be made accessible, to students, researchers, and the general public?
The traditional solution to this problem is for some small number of experts (usually 1) to write an encyclopedia article that attempts to represent the diversity of perspectives in a domain of research with a bunch of sections, each attempting to present that perspective. This is unsatisfactory for many reasons, mostly rooted in the paradoxic of one researcher attempting to 'objectively' characterize many sides of a debate in which that researcher is a participant.
Another problem is that a large amount of knowledge cannot all be represented together without either flattening its diversity, favoring a small number of 'representatives' while ignoring everything else, or just covering everything inadequately for simple lack of space (encyclopedia articles have word limits).
I became acutely aware of the limitations of the medium when I was working on the encyclopedia article on 'Animal Consciousness' for the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy in 2014.




##bibliographic database

records are peer-reviewed publications about animal consciousness

make these searchable by

 * taxa referred to (i.e. what claims the authors make about the phylogenetic distribution of consciousness)
 *author
 *abstract
 *topic tags

how about a modularly constructable search field that can be either rly simple or rly complex because you just can add parameters like in nodebox maybe somehow?
and the results just keep updating





relate these to a phylogenetic tree for visualization/navigation

# exporation interface

right now i'm thinking this has a browse/search panel and an inspect panel

  * browse/search panel

    * links to toggle back and forth between publications, researchers, topics and taxa,
    * list of results
    * collapsable search form to enter query parameters

  * inspect panel
    * lists of related items for the inspected thing:

    * publication:
      * authors
      * topics
      * distribution hypothesis?
      * taxa (mentioned? or what... or should just go with d.h.?)

    * author:
      * publications
      * topics/taxa through publications?
      * distrubtion hypotheses through publications?

    ??this gets tricky because wtf are distribution hypotheses? are they their own kind of db object? they correspond to




# topics
 will have their own little modules, preferably with text articles attached, either externally linked or orig content.


## the core visualization engine

the basic premise of the data visualization project is to display claims made about animal taxanomic groups on a phylogenetic tree, thereby conveying the controversy, debate and uncertainty surrounding the issue, as well as to make the scientific literature accessible by organizing it for exploration in a graphically intuitive way.

# other types of visualization

include concept-relation maps and ciation-network maps
